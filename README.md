# RefactorMe

The ExternalIdService is badly written and is in dire need of a refactor.
Its purpose is to generate an external ID for entities that is passed to it, based on a string template (examples in the class file).

Only refactor `IdService.cs` the rest should be taken as shared code that may not be changed.
You may change code, add comments and add more files.

The solution is runnable as in: no compile errors. Run-time errors may occur.

Good luck.
